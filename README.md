**Title: CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: Password Generator.**
**Introduction:**
This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the task assigned during the CodTech IT Solution internship program. The task involves writing a python program which generates password. This documentation will cover the implementation details, rationale behind the code structure, and insights into the programming techniques utilized. Additionally, it will include information about the intern, Pravallika Kosanam, and assigned ID, COD4196.
**Intern Information:**
Name: Pravallika Kosanam
Intern ID: COD4196


**Task Description**
The task assigned to Pravallika Kosanam during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to write a python program to generate password,"Password Generator"


**Implementation:**
The Implementation of the task involves utilizing python programming to create a password generator. The program uses the random module to generate random characters and the string module to access predefined sets of characters (such as letters, digits, and symbols) for password generation. Below is the code implementation:

'''python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12, complexity="medium"):
    if complexity == "low":
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    elif complexity == "medium":
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    elif complexity == "high":
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation + string.ascii_uppercase
    else:
        print("Invalid complexity level. Using medium complexity.")
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

if __name__ == "__main__":
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))
    complexity = input("Enter the complexity level (low/medium/high): ").lower()
    password = generate_password(length, complexity)
    print("Generated password:", password)

**Code Explanation:**
The code prompts users to input the desired password length and complexity level. It then generates a password by randomly selecting characters from appropriate sets (letters, digits, symbols) based on the chosen complexity level. The generated password is printed to the console. The program ensures password strength by allowing users to customize length and complexity, enhancing security. It encapsulates functionality within a function for modularity and readability.

**Rationale:**
The code offers flexibility by allowing users to specify password length and complexity, enhancing security against unauthorized access. It promotes password strength through diverse character sets and random selection, mitigating the risk of brute-force attacks. Its modular design facilitates easy integration into existing systems, supporting cybersecurity measures with minimal overhead.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion the documentation for the task assigned to Pravallika Kosanam during the CodTech IT Solutions intership program involved writing a python program which generates password according to the level(easy, medium, hard) given in the console. This documentation provides insights into the implementation details, code explanation, and rationale behind the chosen approach. Pravallika Kosanam, with the intern ID COD4196, has effectively completed this task as part of the intership program.
This concludes the documentation for the task "Password Generator" assigned during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program.
